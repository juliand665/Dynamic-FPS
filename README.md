# Dynamic FPS

Dynamic FPS automatically reduces the speed at which minecraft renders when it's not focused (to 1 FPS) or hidden (no renders at all). It also fixes a bug in Vanilla Minecraft that makes it take much more performance in the background than it should.

Download in [the releases section](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases) or on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).
